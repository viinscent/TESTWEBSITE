									<h2>My Projects</h2>
									<p> Over the past year, I have had the privilege of working on 
                                        two transformative projects that have honed my skills in both
                                         front-end and back-end development. As a Software Engineer at 
                                         the YMCA, I developed a Stall Management System that modernized 
                                         facility operations by introducing real-time data tracking and 
                                         secure online processes. Following that, I engineered an Asset 
                                         Management System for Port Madison Enterprise, where I streamlined
                                          device management and optimized user interface design. 
                                          These experiences have strengthened my expertise in web technologies
                                           and user-centric design, positioning me to deliver impactful, 
                                           efficient solutions.</p>

										<h2>Stall Management System</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/ymca.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As a Software Engineer at the YMCA from September to December 2023, I played a key role in developing a Stall Management 
										System that transformed the organization's operations. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I designed and 
										implemented both front-end and back-end components using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JSON. This system enabled dynamic, 
										real-time tracking of stall availability and occupancy, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, I ensured 
										the secure storage of personal information and facility management data, replacing the YMCA's outdated manual,
										 paper-based processes with a modern, streamlined online platform. This transition resulted in a more efficient
										 and reliable system for managing their facilities.</p>

										<h2>Asset Management System</h2>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/pme.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										As a Design Engineer for Port Madison Enterprise from January to March 2024, I engineered a robust asset management 
										system using the web-based platform Snipe-IT, effectively managing over 200 company devices. I redesigned the platform's 
										user interface by incorporating feedback from supervisors and test users, optimizing the layout and color schemes to meet 
										company usability requirements. Additionally, I streamlined system functionality by removing redundant features and transitioning 
										data from Excel spreadsheets to a new comprehensive platform. This overhaul boosted real-time data performance, increasing 
										production accuracy and retention by 4%, 
										while also improving employee task completion speed and overall system efficiency.</p>
