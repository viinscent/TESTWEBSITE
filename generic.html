									<h2>My Work Experience</h2>
									<p> Over the past year, I have had the privilege of working on 
                                        two transformative projects that have honed my skills in both
                                         front-end and back-end development. As a Software Engineer at 
                                         the YMCA, I developed a Stall Management System that modernized 
                                         facility operations by introducing real-time data tracking and 
                                         secure online processes. Following that, I engineered an Asset 
                                         Management System for Port Madison Enterprise, where I streamlined
                                          device management and optimized user interface design. 
                                          These experiences have strengthened my expertise in web technologies
                                           and user-centric design, positioning me to deliver impactful, 
                                           efficient solutions.</p>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/nike.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Since December 2022, I have worked as a Retail Associate at Nike, delivering top-notch customer service in
										 a fast-paced environment. I assist customers by providing in-depth product knowledge, ensuring they make 
										 informed purchasing decisions, and maintaining a positive shopping experience. I also manage merchandise 
										 displays, restock inventory, and ensure that the sales floor is organized and visually appealing. By actively
										  addressing customer needs and offering personalized recommendations, 
										I help enhance customer satisfaction and contribute to the store's operational success.</p>

										<h2>Teaching Assistant</h2>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/gencyber.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>During my GenCyber Internship as a Teaching Assistant, I played a pivotal role in developing and 
										delivering a cybersecurity curriculum. Over the course of 10 weeks, I taught over 50 students per session, 
										covering critical topics such as malware prevention and firewall applications. By refining the teaching methods
										and implementing student feedback, I contributed to a significant improvement in student performance, raising
										average assessment scores from 38% to 81%. 
										This experience not only deepened my technical knowledge but also enhanced my ability to communicate complex
										 concepts effectively.</p>
